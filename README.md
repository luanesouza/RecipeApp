## Color Palette Idea One

Initially I chose to use colors that are usually associated with food.
My first issue with this palette was that I had no control over the pictures rendered by the API.
So I came to the conclusion that choosing more neutral colors would make the recipe pictures pop out more.

## Color Palette Idea Two

The palette I went with is a combination of neutral colors, which makes so that the attention is drawn to the recipes' pictures rather than have the colors and images compete for the users' attention.
